## Academic Research & Projects

**Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture Model for Hospital Diagnostics** | 02/2024–12/2024  
- Developed a model using Dirichlet distribution to predict diagnostic error rates.  
- Simulated data in R and applied model to real-world hospital datasets.

**Efficiency of Double Machine Learning in Causal Inference** | 05/2023–06/2023  
- Compared DML to naive ML using the `npcausal` package in R.  
- Evaluated under various linear and non-linear scenarios.

**Solving Riddles with Deep Learning Models** | 02/2023–05/2023  
- Built a DUMA-BERT model for Chinese/English riddles using the BiRdQA dataset.  
- Achieved 28.5% test and 32.5% training accuracy after fine-tuning.
