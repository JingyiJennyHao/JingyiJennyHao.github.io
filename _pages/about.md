My name is Jingyi Hao, and I am currently a Ph.D. student in Statistics at North Carolina State University. Previously, I earned a masterâ€™s degree in Data Science from Johns Hopkins University in 2023, and dual bachelor's degrees in Mathematics & Applied Mathematics and German Literature from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2022.

My research interests include survival analysis, deep learning, and the development of statistical methods for electronic medical records, particularly in the context of neurological diseases.

In my free time, I enjoy running, playing chess, cooking, and traveling.
