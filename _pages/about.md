My name is Jingyi Hao, and I am currently a Ph.D. student in Statistics at North Carolina State University. Previously, I earned a masterâ€™s degree in Data Science from Johns Hopkins University, and dual bachelor's degrees in Mathematics & Applied Mathematics and German Literature from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research interests include survival analysis, deep learning, and the development of statistical methods for electronic medical records.

In my free time, I enjoy running, playing chess, cooking, and traveling.
