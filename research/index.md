My research focuses on deep learning model, survival analysis and statistical models for EHRs (electronical medical records). Below are some of my research projects.

## Dirichlet-Multinomial Mixture Model for Evaluating Hospital Diagnostic Performance

Improving healthcare quality relies heavily on accurately evaluating and reducing misdiagnosis-related risk. We proposed a Dirichlet-Multinomial mixture model with a regression structure to estimate hospital-level distributions of misdiagnosis-related harm and predict misdiagnosis probabilities. The model also enables the inclusion of covariates to explain differences in risk, providing hospitals with actionable insights.

## Linear Layers with Length Penalty for Curve Coefficient Estimation

This project develops neural network models trained on simulated data to estimate curve coefficients for regression tasks. By using synthetic 2D curves, the model learns to capture curve structures beyond basic features. We apply the method to the MNIST dataset to extract centerline representations, showcasing how deep learning can approximate principal curves without retraining on real-world datasets.
